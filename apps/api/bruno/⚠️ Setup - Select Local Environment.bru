  # üö® IMPORTANT: Select "Local" Environment
  
  **Before testing any endpoints, make sure to:**
  
  1. Click on the environment dropdown at the top
  2. Select "Local" environment
  3. Verify that api_url resolves to: http://localhost:3001
  
  If "No Environment" is selected, the {{api_url}} variable will not work!
  
  This request will help you verify the environment is working correctly.
