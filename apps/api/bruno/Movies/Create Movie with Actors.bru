  # Create Movie with Actors
  
  Test case for creating a movie with multiple actors assigned during creation.
  
  **ðŸ”’ Requires API Token Authentication**
  
  ## Test Case
  This request demonstrates:
  - Creating a movie with complete metadata
  - Assigning multiple actors with their roles during creation
  - Proper validation of actor IDs
  
  ## Expected Response
  - Movie created successfully
  - Actors array populated with full actor details
  - Each actor has movieId, actorId, and role
  - Actor objects include id, name, biography, birthDate
  
  ## Error Cases to Test
  - Invalid actorId (should return 404 for Actor not found)
  - Missing role (should return validation error)
  - Duplicate actorId in same request (should be handled gracefully)
  
  ## Example
  ```
  POST /movies
  ```
